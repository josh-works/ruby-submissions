## 1: Contributing to Exercism docs [Documentation patch]

### Extract "The Contribution Workflow" from CONTRIBUTING.md
https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/issues/3252 (Already got permission from Katrina Owen)

Other potential options: https://github.com/exercism/docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc

#### why

I love Exercisms, so I looked there for my first OSS contribution.

I think I might be a good candidate to make this PR, because I'm basically writing it for people who are just like me - newbies, with little/no prior contribution experience.

And, because of the nature of the PR, I suspect I'll get great feedback from more experienced people along the way.

#### What

Exercism attracts many newbie programmers (like me) and it's a great opportunity for them to figure out how to contribute to the repo, just as I am using this PR to figure this all out.

#### I need

To draft up the instructions as well as possible, pass around to my instructors internally to get their feedback, then pass around to the exercism community for THEIR feedback

#### When I'm done

Exercism will have well-documented instructions on how to make a new PR, written for someone who's never contributed before.
